### 3. Testing Your AI

- Test with messages similar to what you actually receive
- If responses don't match your style, import more chats
- The AI learns from patterns in your messages

## Troubleshooting

### "Please set your API key in Settings"
- You haven't entered an API key yet
- Go to Settings and add your OpenAI API key

### "Error importing: No messages found"
- The chat file format might be incorrect
- Make sure you exported "Without media"
- Check that your name is spelled exactly as in the chat

### "Error generating response"
- Check your internet connection
- Verify your API key is correct
- Ensure you have credits in your OpenAI account
- Try using GPT-3.5 instead of GPT-4

### Import shows 0 messages
- Your name doesn't match the name in the chat
- The chat file might be corrupted
- Try exporting the chat again

### AI responses don't sound like me
